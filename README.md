## Summary:

Based on the data analyzed, I would like to suggest three business recommendations.   As the data indicates, urban markets are soaring compared to rural and suburban markets.   After reviewing this information here are three recommendations with additional data points to review as well as possible solutions:

1. Determine the operational costs within suburban and rural regions to examime further if services should be discontinued or shut down.  Understanding operational costs would be extremely valuable to determine to see if there are efforts on the ground floor of these regions, particulary rural areas.  It may also reveal to see if more operational efforts are needed and work with stakeholders in the operations side of the business to work on on-boarding more drivers and in person or online support to drivers.   
2. Since there are already drivers signed on to the Pyber platform, it would in the best interested to start incentivizing so that drivers do not seek other forms of gig economy.   In the urban areas it would be more likely for a driver to aim for a total number of rides as those areas tend to be heavier traffic, more events, and high traffic areas.   Incentives for rural areas could be more focusing on getting drivers to sign on and stay on the platform, possibly hours dedicated to be signed onto the platform.  
3. Final recommendation would if in fact there is no heavy operational costs within the rural areas, it would be recommended to focus on target marketing or expanding product features within that region.   Exploring rural areas expansion of services for schools (elementary - high school students), events, day trips, messenger/errands and elder care could in fact increase revenue as well as drum up local businesses in rural areas.   Marketing these types of product expansison would be an example:  working with the hospital and doctor offices in the areas to provide services for their elder patients to not worry about transportation or driving.
